ButtonWithBorderAndHover
==============================================

This project was used as a sample of the post [UIButton with border and hover native iOS](http://www.jairobjunior.com/blog/2014/02/03/creating-uibutton-with-border-and-hover-native-ios/). 

There I describe how to create a button with a different background color for the highlighted state and how you can change the boder color for all buttons in your app.
